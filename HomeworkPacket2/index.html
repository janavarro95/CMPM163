		<p>Welcome to the page for Homework Packet 2</p>
		
		<p>
		Description: Problem A revolves around height maps and applying it using a texture and making water reflective. It's a reflection blended with the color blue.
		<br>
		The creative aspect that I attempted
		to do was create my own control system for the camera instead of using Oribtal Controls. 
		You can modify the displacement amount of the terrain and the height of of the body of water.
		<br>
		Rotation: Arrow Keys
		<br>
		Move Camera:
		<br>
		W: Camera.y+;
		<br>
		S: Camera.y-;
		<br>
		A: Camera.X-;
		<br>
		D: Camera.X+;
		<br>

		Mouse Scroll: Zoom the camera in and out by moving it's Z position.

		<p>Problem B focuses on using a particle system to mimic a natural phenomena.
			<br>
			The natural phenomena I try to mimic is the effect of shooting starts flying through the night sky.
			<br>
			The noise functions I use take the system type and use it to generate how many big stars show on the screen.
			The other noise functions use some Math.random values to generate the color of the stars, the position of the stars, and the velocity of the stars and how many smaller particles stars spawn.
			<br>
			I built the forefront particle system from scratch that uses the big stars with the small star trails. It was challenging but very fun. The bakcground uses Three.js pointsprites with buffered geometry.
