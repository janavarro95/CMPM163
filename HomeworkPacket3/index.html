		Problem A is not included due to extra credit and lack of time.

		Problem B is the shader toy example where I use SDFs to create a "scene" using only the fragment shader.
		I emulate phong shading on the object as it transforms from a sphere to a cyliner and then when the timer maxes out I use
		a calculation to subtract the sphere from the cyliner to get the two rings effect.

		This is my research towards the final project where I hypothesis about global illumination also known as indirect lighting.
